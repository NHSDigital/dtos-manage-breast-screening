# Manage breast screening Django spike

[![Main branch CI](https://github.com/nhsdigital/manage-breast-screening-django-spike/actions/workflows/cicd-1-main-branch.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhsdigital/manage-breast-screening-django-spike/actions/workflows/cicd-1-main-branch.yaml)

This repo is a spike to explore using Django as the framework for our new service.

The new service is a system for managing breast screening clinics, including:

- Viewing and managing daily clinic lists
- Tracking participants through their screening journey
- Managing participant information and status

## Running the app

## Setup

To install the toolchain dependencies, run

```shell
make config
```

This command assumes you have a few things already installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later

## Usage

If dependencies have been installed correctly, you shoul dbe able to run

```sh
poetry install
poetry run ./manage.py migrate
poetry run ./manage.py loaddata example
cp manage_breast_screening/config/.env.tpl manage_breast_screening/config/.env
npm install
npm run compile:css
poetry run ./manage.py runserver
```

Alternatively, you can use the `make` shortcuts:

```sh
make dependencies
make run
```

### Testing

```sh
make test
```

### Django admin
We'll probably remove it before deploying to production, but currently Django admin is enabled.

To use it, first create a superuser

```sh
poetry run ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then run the app and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin`

## Design

### Structure

The `manage_breast_screening` directory contains all the Django project code.

`config` is a subpackage containing the configuration. The other subpackages - such as `clinics` - are [Django apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/applications/). These each represent a bounded context within our overall domain of screening events. Django apps can be built with customisability and extendability in mind, and published as python packages, but we aren't doing that yet.

To generate a new app, run:

```sh
poetry run ./manage.py startapp <app_name> manage_breast_screening/`
```

## Contributing

- Make sure you have `pre-commit` running so that pre-commit hooks run automatically when you commit - this should have been set up automatically when you ran `make config`.
- Consider switching on format-on-save in your editor (e.g. [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for python)
- (Internal contributions only) contact the `#screening-manage` team on slack with any questions

### Makefile and Scripts
`scripts/` contains various scripts that can be used in the CI/CD workflows.
